        <h1>The Vending Machine</h1>
        <h3>An Exercise in User Interface Analysis</h3>
        <div class="green">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The vending machine aims to provide users with quick and easy access to snacks and drinks. 
            </p>
            <p>Brown University hosts many vending machines. This analysis targets a machine sitting in Vartan Gregorian Quad 
                (near Josiah’s dining hall) that contains food items. 
            </p>
        

            <h2>The Interface</h2>
            <p>The vending machine’s interface facilitates user payment and delivery of an item from the machine to the user. 
                This machine’s interface consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A food display case</li>
                <li>A panel across the bottom of the machine with a coin return and item drop box</li>
                <li>A panel along the right side of the machine with selection and payment features
                    <ul>
                        <li>Selection features: a BLUE selection screen; keypad</li>
                        <li>Payment features: cash receiver, coin slot, BLUE selection screen, card reader (swipe bar and tap pad) 
                            with GREEN payment screen. Card reader (on student ID swipe) also accepts FLEX Points, a type of meal plan 
                            credit at Brown. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many different payment types are used.</li>
                    <li>Payment confusion: Do you pay before or after selecting an item? How do FLEX Pts work?</li>
                    <li>2 screens is confusing and unnecessary.</li>
                    <li>Hard to read very small words.</li>
                    <li>Card reader is too low, the attached green screen is hard to read.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Interviews</h2>
            <img src="interviews.png" style="max-width: 110%; margin-left: 10%;"/>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>User “flow” is not well documented. For example, it is not clear whether user should select item or pay first. </li>
                    <li>Two screens is “very confusing” and unnecessary. Users pay attention to one or the other, not both.</li>
                    <li>Low card reader is difficult to use and lessens machine “credibility”. Also spread too far from other payment features (like cash receiver/coin slot).</li>
                    <li>Needs more labels for all features and in bigger text.</li>
                    <li>Keypad buttons are not intuitive—users don’t know what they mean. Every user thought the “coin return” button had something to do with hand sanitation. </li>
                </ul>
